Hello guys, I'm Rishabh!
I live in India yet I call many spots my home(My Laptop). I am as of now pursuing Information Security and I'm exceptionally excited with regards to it.
At the point when I initially caught wind of the term hacking and The idea of Breaking into frameworks, I thought that it is very fascinating and cool.

I'm energetic with regards to this work and along these lines always looking for new and innovative thoughts to bring to a project.
When I'm not working I go on Tracks, YES! I'm a climber, I love what I do and venerate the inventive process. I'm a sympathetic individual who doesn't feel offended when individuals call me delicate.
Feeling things profoundly is my superpower.
